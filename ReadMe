#This is a brief introduction of my work
#
# GetDataFromIDA.py
#	read data from IDA results into a txt file
#
# WriteDataIntoFile.py
#	read data from txt file into memory
#
# PreOperationMethod1.py
#	exert pre-operation method 1
#
# AbstractionMethod1.py
#	using abstraction method 1 to simplify the graph
#
# AbstractionMethod2.py
#	using abstraction method 2 to simplify the graph
#
# AbstractionMethod3.py
#	using abstraction method 3 to simplify the graph
#
# ABOVE is for debugging seperately. And each file is an integreate exe.
# 
#
# WholeAbstractionCode.py
#	this is an integrated code from the last 5 independent files and it can finish all the abstraction work.
#	please be noted that currently there is no inner construction inside each merged node. This work needs to be done further. 
#	I am working to simplify the whole code into functions in different files, which is more easy to call and analysis. And I am also working to build data constructions inside each node.
